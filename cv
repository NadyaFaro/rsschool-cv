Now my goal is to become a good iOS Developer. To be a programmer is my dream from childhood. Because my mother was a programmer. I don’t have technical or engineer education. I have experience in sales and marketing for more than 10 years.  However I don’t have education in sales or marketing. I was learning new skills all my professional life. So I’m sure that I will be successful in studying iOS Development Course from Rolling Scopes School. You can see and estimate my code. I attached a few links to my projects on GitHub below. There are tasks I carried out several months ago.
**Skills:**
*X-code, Git, Jira
*MVC
*UI-Kit, Cocoa Pods, CoreAnimation
*JSON, Alomafire, URLSession
*CoreData, Realm
**Experience** (tasks from studying)
